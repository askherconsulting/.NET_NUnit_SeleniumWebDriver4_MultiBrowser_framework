# .NET_NUnit_SeleniumWebDriver4_CrossBrowser_Automation_Framework
 A basic automation framework for C#/.NET using latest Selenium and multiple browser drivers.
Based upon Carlos Kidman's excellent Test Automation University Course: https://testautomationu.applitools.com/test-automation-framework-csharp/

This framework demonstrates running the same test against Chrome, Edge(Chromium) and Firefox browsers.

Please ensure you are using the correct Driver versions for the instance of the browser you have installed.

Here is a video to demonstrate how I did this for Edge, the same principles apply to all browsers:-
